#START UP INVESTMENT ANALYSIS#
In the below the data taken from US SHARK TANK DATA containing different industries and pitchers
"C:\Users\manoh\Downloads\Shark_Tank_US_dataset.csv.csv" 

Then in the given below data I cleaned and organized the dataset by focusing on the key columns: Industry (domain) and Sum of Total Deal Amount (funding). 
I standardized the domain names in the Industry column and ensured that all funding figures were valid numeric values.
Then, I grouped the records by each domain, summing the Total Deal Amounts to get a clear picture of funding trends by domain. 
This approach provided an aggregated view of startup investments across different industries

In the above data I analyzed the founder profiles by focusing on the key demographic fields in the dataset—specifically the "Pitchers Gender" and "Count of Pitchers Average Age" columns.
I grouped the data by industry and compared the success rates and funding amounts among male, female, and mixed teams. 
This revealed distinct trends in deal outcomes across different founder profiles. 
Overall, this enabled insights into how diversity in founder profiles correlates with funding success on Shark Tank US..

In the above I evaluated funding stage success by focusing on the “Got Deal” flag in the pivot dataset.
I calculated conversion rates by comparing pitches that secured deals (Got Deal = 1) against total pitches in each industry and founder subgroup. 
This approach was validated by matching the aggregated deal amounts with the summed individual funding figures. 
Overall, the analysis revealed clear trends in which domains and team compositions were more successful in advancing past the funding stage...

In the below dataset there is a seperated Got Deal list which was like funded industires or startups by the sharks which includes-
-INDUSTY NAME, STARTUP NAME, AND SUM OF TOTAL DEAL AMOUNT CALCULATED in a seperate companies funded list

In the given below image I imported the cleaned CSV data into Power BI and immediately dived into creating a ring chart that visalises the funding across different industries.
Each segment of the chart represents an industry’s proportional share of the total deal amount, making comparisons intuitive
I applied a custom color scheme to ensure that each industry is distinct and communicates its unique performance
Interactive tooltips were enabled, allowing any user to lookup over a segment for more detailed figures like the exact deal amount and count of pitches
This visualization provides a quick, at-a-glance understanding of how the funding is distributed across sectors

In the given below image 
 I built a combination chart that mixed bars and a line to show how funding stages and success rates change.
 The bars display metrics such as the number of deals or the average funding per stage, while the overlaid line shows how these values progress over time or across stages.
 I added interactive filters (slicers) so users can easily sort the data by factors like Pitchers’ Gender or Industry, making it more engaging.
 I kept the design neat and consistent so the information flows like a clear story, guiding viewers through the main insights.
 This approach makes it easier to see trends and differences, effectively summarizing the performance of startups throughout their funding journey

How I Used the Excel CSV Data 
I imported the structured CSV file and verified that all key columns—Industry, Funding Amounts, and Pitch Metrics—are correctly defined.
I transformed and cleaned the raw CSV data to ensure consistency and accuracy before modeling in Power BI.
DAX functions were applied to create calculated measures that form the backbone of the interactive visualizations.
The cleaned data dynamically powers every chart and slicer, making the dashboard responsive and deeply informative
