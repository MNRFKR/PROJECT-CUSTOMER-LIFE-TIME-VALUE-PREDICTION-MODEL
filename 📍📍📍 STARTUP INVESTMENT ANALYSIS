#START UP INVESTMENT ANALYSIS#
In the below the data taken from US SHARK TANK DATA containing different industries and pitchers
"C:\Users\manoh\Downloads\Shark_Tank_US_dataset.csv.csv" 

Then in the given below data I cleaned and organized the dataset by focusing on the key columns: Industry (domain) and Sum of Total Deal Amount (funding). 
I standardized the domain names in the Industry column and ensured that all funding figures were valid numeric values.
Then, I grouped the records by each domain, summing the Total Deal Amounts to get a clear picture of funding trends by domain. 
This approach provided an aggregated view of startup investments across different industries

In the above data I analyzed the founder profiles by focusing on the key demographic fields in the dataset—specifically the "Pitchers Gender" and "Count of Pitchers Average Age" columns.
I grouped the data by industry and compared the success rates and funding amounts among male, female, and mixed teams. 
This revealed distinct trends in deal outcomes across different founder profiles. 
Overall, this enabled insights into how diversity in founder profiles correlates with funding success on Shark Tank US..

In the above I evaluated funding stage success by focusing on the “Got Deal” flag in the pivot dataset.
I calculated conversion rates by comparing pitches that secured deals (Got Deal = 1) against total pitches in each industry and founder subgroup. 
This approach was validated by matching the aggregated deal amounts with the summed individual funding figures. 
Overall, the analysis revealed clear trends in which domains and team compositions were more successful in advancing past the funding stage...

In the below dataset there is a seperated Got Deal list which was like funded industires or startups by the sharks which includes-
