#START UP INVESTMENT ANALYSIS#
In the below the data taken from US SHARK TANK DATA containing different industries and pitchers
"C:\Users\manoh\Downloads\Shark_Tank_US_dataset.csv.csv"
Then in the given below data I cleaned and organized the dataset by focusing on the key columns: Industry (domain) and Sum of Total Deal Amount (funding). 
I standardized the domain names in the Industry column and ensured that all funding figures were valid numeric values.
Then, I grouped the records by each domain, summing the Total Deal Amounts to get a clear picture of funding trends by domain. 
This approach provided an aggregated view of startup investments across different industries
